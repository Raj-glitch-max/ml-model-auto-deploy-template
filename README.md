 ML Model Auto Deployment with Docker

# 🤖 ML Model Auto Deployment with Docker

This project automates the entire ML deployment process using **Flask** and **Docker**. You can easily plug in your own trained ML model and instantly deploy it with a web interface for predictions.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔁 Replaceable ML model (just drop your `.pkl`)
- 🌐 Flask web interface for input & predictions
- 🐳 Dockerized for easy deployment anywhere
- 🧠 No need to touch backend code for basic use

## 🛠️ How to Use This Project with Your Model

### 1️⃣ Replace the ML Model
- Train your own model in Python (e.g., `RandomForest`, `XGBoost`, etc.)
- Save it using:
  ```python
  import joblib
  joblib.dump(model, "model.pkl")
Place your model.pkl in the deploy_app/ folder (replace existing one)
Make sure your model uses .predict() method and expects the same number of inputs as your form.

2️⃣ Edit the Input Form (Optional)
Go to deploy_app/templates/index.html
Update the placeholders if your model expects more or fewer features:
html
Copy
Edit
Enter 5 features (comma separated):
e.g., 1.2, 3.4, 5.6, ...

3️⃣ Build the Docker Image
Open terminal inside the deploy_app/ folder and run:
bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t ml-auto-app .

4️⃣ Run the Container
bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -p 5000:5000 ml-auto-app
Visit 👉 http://localhost:5000
You should see a web form where you can enter features and get predictions.

🌍 Hosting on the Cloud (Optional)
You can host this app on:
AWS EC2
Railway.app
Render.com
Azure / GCP
VPS (using Nginx + Docker)
Ask if you want deployment help 🚀

✅ Example
Input: 5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2
Output: Predicted Class: Iris-setosa

👨‍💻 Tech Stack
